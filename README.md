Clustering Project
📌 Project Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to group similar data points together and uncover hidden patterns.
The goal is to identify natural groupings in the dataset and generate insights that can support decision-making.

🗂 Dataset

Source: (mention dataset source – e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, or internal company dataset)

Size: X rows × Y columns

Features: (list key features – e.g., age, income, purchase frequency, etc.)

Target: Unsupervised problem (no labeled target variable)

🔑 Key Steps

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

Removing duplicates or irrelevant features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics

Visualizations (pairplots, histograms, boxplots)

Correlation analysis

Clustering Techniques Used:

K-Means Clustering

(Optional: mention others like Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN if used)

Elbow Method / Silhouette Score used to find optimal number of clusters

Visualization of Results:

2D or 3D cluster plots

Cluster profiles (mean values per cluster)

Insights drawn from each cluster

📊 Results & Insights

Optimal Clusters: X (e.g., 3 clusters identified)

Key Insights:

Cluster 1 → High-income, frequent buyers

Cluster 2 → Low-spend, irregular customers

Cluster 3 → Moderate spenders with potential to upsell

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (list what you actually used)
